# Setting up Google Tag Manager

This guide walks you through creating and configuring a Google Tag Manager container for your organization.

## 1. Create a GTM Container

- Go to [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com)
- Click "Create Account"
- Choose:
  - Account Name: Your company name
  - Container Name: e.g. `cohost-site`
  - Target platform: Web

## 2. Retrieve Your GTM ID

Once created, you’ll get a `GTM-XXXXXXX` container ID. Save this — you'll use it when integrating with Cohost.

## 3. Set Up Basic Tags (Optional)

Add basic tags like:
- Google Analytics 4
- Meta Pixel
- Hotjar (if needed)

You can manage them later once Cohost events are flowing in.
